ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luis Antonio Montoya Morales, IPN-ESCOM's studient. I am interested in videogame development, digital art and computational systems. 
Im doing my first steps in all these disciplines, so i can't colaborate in big projects... maybe in another time. 

You can find in my GITHUB profile my institutional homeworks, testing projects, tools for make the institutional life easier and little personal projects.

Can you find me in Twitter as @Devlumniom, I post there my #beginner_devblog, in other words you can follow my steps closely.
